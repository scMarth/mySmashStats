# mySmashStats

A work-in-progress project for keeping records of your head-to-heaad stats.

Currently, the Windows branch contains a batch-file to retrieve match history data, parse it, and then display the statistics.

The master branch does the same in Linux using the make update command in the source directory, but doesn't work in Windows.
